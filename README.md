Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic application of engineering principles and methods in the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. Its importance is enable the creation of software applications in the different aspects of life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of software engineering as a discipline.
The advent of structured programming.
The development of programming languages.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements is the collecting of system requirements and user needs.
Design is the creating of quality designs for the software needs and user interface.
Implementation is the writing of codes and software building according to the design.
Testing is the running of different tests on the code to ensure the requirements are met and it is of high standard.
Deployment is the releasing of the software to the users.
maintenance is the performing of systemic improvements after the deployment of the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is sequential approach with differentdistinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall while agile methodology is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and response to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer writes codes and implements software solutions.
A project manager manages the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
A quality assurance engineer ensures that the softwre is of high quality by running tests to the software.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provides environment for writing, debugging and testing code eg visual studio and jetbrain while VCS are tools for tracking changes made to the source code and coordintion of team members work.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Change of requirements may be overcome by always ensuring effective communication is maintained.
Tight deadlines may be overcome by prioritization of tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing individual components of a software.
System testing is testing the whole software.
Acceptance testing is testing the software according to the user requirements and needs. 
The importance of software quality assurance is to identify and fix bugs and malfunctions earlier in software development.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the process of where detailed guidance is given to AI to generate desired outputs it importance is that the ouput that is given is of high standards.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague prompt is recommend a good car. The improved prompt should read as recommend a good diesel automatic car with a 2000cc engine preferably a mazda suitable for use in the Kenyan market with a budget of not more than three million. The prompt is more effective since it is detailed and the output will not be vague.
